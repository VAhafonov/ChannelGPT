## Hello everyone!

I had several Telegram channels, but I didn't enjoy managing them. It was time-consuming, and I constantly had to search for new topics and information for the channels. That's when I decided to create this project. 
It's an **entirely free gpt-3.5-turbo that will manage your channel for you.** You just need to set up the virtual environment variables and run the bot with a single command. 

The bot remembers the last 5 messages it sent to your channel. And always write interesting posts.

Interested? Here's the complete guide:

## Run on Replit
- If you don't have account on [Replit](https://replit.com/), create it. It's Free.
- Click this button and deploy my repository to your Replit account.
